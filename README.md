# Event Driven Ideal Gas
Event driven MD simulation of a classical particle bouncing around in a box.

To compile:
    g++ -std=c++11 src/main.cpp src/box.cpp -o md

Interesting extensions to work on:
1. understand unit of pressure
2. visualize trajectories
3. add more particles
4. implement hard-core collission as events
5. check pressure again
